# In the text file named 'InfixExpression' type a mathematical expression you would like to compute.
# You can use multi-digit numbers like 864.
# You can use floating point numbers like 3.14.
# You can't use negative numbers (I haven't implemented it yet).
# Do not include spaces in your input.
# You can use the following operators: + - / * ^ ()
# Example: 0.25*(8512-2^9)+25 will compute 2025.
#
# When the program is run, input a number for the floating point precision.
